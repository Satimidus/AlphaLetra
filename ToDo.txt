This program will take an image, convert it into grayscale and using the values of
0-255, for black to white, will determine the density of "points" per a certain 
given area to draw. This is akin to the art technique called stippling, except that
this program will accept a single character as input to substitute for the "points"
that are present in stippling. 

Additionally, input will accept either character input from the keyboard, or a
character drawn on a canvas. 

===================================================================================

TO DO (from most to least significant):
	- import images
		-grayscale conversion
		-image "simplification"; data reduction
	- point density determination
	- character input
		if [keyboard input]
			use .ttf
		else if [canvas input]
			take input
			convert to alpha img or .ttf(?)
	- utils
	- publishing output
